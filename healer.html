            Welcome back to <i>What's My Role Again?</i> A beginners' guide to FFXIV roles and how to play them! If you haven't at least skimmed <a href="tank.html">Part One</a>, I strongly recommend doing that now, as it explains things like GCD/oGCD abilities, as well as what Superbolide is and why healers shouldn't panic when they see it. This is especially important because this, Part Two, is going to deal with healers, our beloved green DPS.

            As a healer, there are two big things to remember: <strong>Everyone's lives are in your hands</strong>, and <strong>don't panic</strong>. Easy, right? In reality, the first thing is far less intimidating than it seems, and practice should counter the second.
            <br>

            <span class="important">IMPORTANT NOTE #1:</span> Sage is a perfectly viable healer. It should not be the first healer that you level. Healing requires a solid grasp of both fundamentals and your job's specific toolkit, arguably moreso than either of the other roles. If you start your first healer at level 70, you won't get the necessary practice in general that proficient healing requires, and you won't know how to use a lower level healer's toolkit. Running level synced content with a healer who is unfamiliar with their early-game kit can be incredibly deadly. If you're interested in Sage, Scholar is the most comparable healer, and I strongly recommend running it to at least level 50 first.

            When you first start healing, your first instinct will likely be to keep your party at max health as much as possible. However, trying to keep your party constantly topped up is suboptimal for a couple of reasons:
            <br>
            <br>
            Firstly, healers should be dealing damage! The best way to keep your party alive is to kill the thing that's dealing damage to them. Make sure to keep your DOT up as much as possible, and when you're not healing, you should be casting your primary damage spell as much as humanly (Hyur-ly?) possible.

              A DOT, or Damage Over Time, is an ability that does exactly what it says on the tin - it won't hit very hard at first, but it will deal a small amount of damage every tick. Yes, I said small, but this adds up over time - use them! You should ideally be recasting, or "refreshing" your DOTs as close to their expiry as possible, as you cannot stack them to extend their duration. If you forget your DOT in lieu of doing things like "dodging AOEs" or "raising your cohealer because oh god everyone is DEAD" don't worry too much, though - you can't DPS if you're dead.
