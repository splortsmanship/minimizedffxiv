            Welcome back to What's My Role Again? A beginners' guide to FFXIV roles and how to play them! If you haven't at least skimmed <a href="tank.html">Part One</a>, I strongly recommend doing that now, as it explains things like GCD/oGCD abilities, as well as what Superbolide is and why healers shouldn't panic when they see it. This is especially important because this, Part Two, is going to deal with healers, our beloved green DPS.
