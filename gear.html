          <p>
            Gear comes in several different iLvl (item level) brackets over the course of a tier. Higher item level = more health, better substats, etc. Due to restrictions placed on how many pieces of a given type of gear you can get within a given week (resetting every Tuesday morning), you will not be able to get your BiS (Best in Slot) gear right away. What's your jobâ€™s BiS? Google it. Seriously.

            <br>
            <br>
            Most of your starting prog set will be crafted gear. This - shockingly - is gear that you or one of your crafter friends crafts. You can also buy it from the marketboard, but DIY is always, always cheaper. This is also the only type of gear that can be overmelded, which will be touched on later. It's worth noting here that crafting your own gear will require you to have fully leveleld crafters (save for CUL), and likely pretty hefty melds on your crafter gear, so it's not something you'll be able to bash out on a whim - if you want to raid in a new tier and don't want to sell a kidney to afford a crafted set, start preparing early!
            <br>
            <br>
            <span class="important">Normal Raid Drops:</span>
            Once per floor per week, you can obtain a raid gear token that can be exchanged for a piece of normal raid gear. Notably, this exchange is not 1:1 (except in the case of accessories), and not every floor drops every kind of token! See below for a handy cheat sheet:
          </p>
          <div class="infobox">
            <p>
              <span class="infotitle">Token Drops & Exchange Rates</span>
              <br>
              <br>
              <strong>Head (2:1):</strong> Floors 1-3<br>
              <strong>Body (4:1):</strong> All floors<br>
              <strong>Hands (2:1):</strong> All floors<br>
              <strong>Legs (4:1):</strong> All floors<br>
              <strong>Feet (2:1):</strong> Floors 1-2<br>
              <strong>Accessories (1:1):</strong> All floors
            </p>
          </div>
          <p>
            Additionally, the fourth floor of the tier will drop one weapon token every week. This is guaranteed, and goes straight into your inventory, and <em>if your inventory is full, you will simply lose it, so do not do that</em>. Seven (reduced later in the patch cycle) of these can be exchanged for a tomestone which, when combined with capped tomestones (more on those in a second), will give you an iLvl 620 weapon.
          </p>
          <h3 class="section">ILVL 620: AUGMENTED CRAFTED & TOMESTONE</h3>
          <p>
            <span class="important">Augmented Crafted Gear:</span>
            <br>
            <br>
            Generally released in the next major patch after the raid tier drops, tomestone gear acts as one of two catchup gearsets (the other being gear dropped from Alliance raids). It is acquired by trading in one piece of base crafted gear and a handful of the current <em>uncapped</em> (no limit to how many can be obtained per week) tomestones (currently <strong>Allagan Tomestones of Astronomy</strong>). Notably, the only way for this trade to be 1:1 is if the gearpiece you are trading in is high quality. <strong>DO NOT exchanged NQ gear,</strong> as it requires multiple NQ pieces to make the exchange, and will be much more costly. However, the gear piece that you trade in <em>does not</em> need to be for the same job as the one that you are trading <em>for</em>. So, for example, if you're looking for an augmented aiming chestpiece, but can get a HQ healing chestpiece for less Gil, buy the healing piece and trade it in.
