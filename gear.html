          <p>
            Gear comes in several different iLvl (item level) brackets over the course of a tier. Higher item level = more health, better substats, etc. Due to restrictions placed on how many pieces of a given type of gear you can get within a given week (resetting every Tuesday morning), you will not be able to get your BiS (Best in Slot) gear right away. What's your jobâ€™s BiS? Google it. Seriously.

            <br>
            Most of your starting prog set will be crafted gear. This - shockingly - is gear that you or one of your crafter friends crafts. You can also buy it from the marketboard, but DIY is always, always cheaper. This is also the only type of gear that can be overmelded, which will be touched on later. It's worth noting here that crafting your own gear will require you to have fully leveleld crafters (save for CUL), and likely pretty hefty melds on your crafter gear, so it's not something you'll be able to bash out on a whim - if you want to raid in a new tier and don't want to sell a kidney to afford a crafted set, start preparing early!

            <span class="important">Normal Raid Drops:</span>
            Once per floor per week, you can obtain a raid gear token that can be exchanged for a piece of normal raid gear. Notably, this exchange is not 1:1 (except in the case of accessories), and not every floor drops every kind of token! See below for a handy cheat sheet:
